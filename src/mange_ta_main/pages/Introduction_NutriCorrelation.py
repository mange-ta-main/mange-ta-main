### When Recipes Speak Health ü©∫

In a world where food plays a central role in our well-being, understanding the connection between our culinary habits and public health has become essential. 
**NutriCorrelations** is a collaborative initiative between our organization and the Ministry of Health, aiming to explore these links using data from several sources.
            
As a first step towards understaning these links, we propose to analyse the 
[Food.com Recipes and Interactions dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions/data) made available by [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
This dataset consists of 180K+ recipes and 700K+ recipe reviews covering 18 years of user interactions and uploads on Food.com (formerly GeniusKitchen).         
       
Each recipe is rated based on nutritional value, taste, and practicality.
By cross-referencing this data with public health indicators, we aim to uncover meaningful correlations between certain types of dishes and observed health outcomes, such as chronic diseases, nutrient deficiencies, or obesity trends.

On this site, you‚Äôll find **interactive statistics**, **clear visualizations**, and **accessible analyses** that reveal how our cooking habits and dietary patterns may impact our collective health.
            

Whether you‚Äôre a healthcare professional, researcher, educator, or simply curious, you‚Äôll discover tools that will help you to better understand how our food habits and choices shape well-being.
            

Our mission: to **raise awareness**, **inform**, and **encourage** healthier eating habits through reliable data.
            

Explore, compare, and join a citizen-driven approach to informed nutrition.
