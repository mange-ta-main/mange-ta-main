Whatever the reason, is our choices of food may not always be the best ones from a nutritional point of view. A poor

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), NCDs result from a combination of several factors, such as, genetic, physiological, envinmental and behavioural
[[3](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/noncommunicable-diseases)].

Behavioural factor include

- unhealthy diets, including excess salt, sugar, and fats as well as*
- insufficient physical activity
- harmful use of alcohol; and
- tobacco use (including the effects of exposure to second-hand smoke)


Eating poorly could lead to conditions like high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol, and obesity.

st.markdown('''The answer is straightforward!
Home cooking is associated with numerous health benefits, including a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and other chronic diseases
[[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7232892/)]. People who cook at home eat higher quality food, consume less calories, spend
 less money on food, and have less weight gain over time than those who dine out and eat prepared foods on a regular basis.

Conversely, consuming prepared, ultraprocessed foods has been linked to increased rates of cardiometabolic diseases and overall cancer
 risk as well as breast cancer risk.
